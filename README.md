### What I Learned

This project helped me practice building a clean and responsive layout using semantic HTML and CSS. I also learned how to implement a light and dark theme using CSS variables and a data attribute on the root element, allowing easy and scalable theme switching without duplicating styles.

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg: hsl(222, 47%, 11%);
  --card-bg: hsl(215, 28%, 17%);
}
````

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility improvements, smooth UI animations, and building more interactive components using JavaScript and React.
